# ***edu.yaprnn***, formerly ***Yet Another Pattern Recognizing Neural Network***

Multilayer Networks (MLN) are easy to understand but need deep machine learning knowledge to master.
The `edu.yaprnn` app helps you learn MLNs by letting you experiment with sample data, network
settings, and training parameters.

In the app, you create and train MLNs using MNIST digit images and vocal sound files.

Our team of 5-6 students developed the original version for a machine learning course years ago. I
updated it to fix old issues. The original version is at
the [yaprnn repository](https://code.google.com/archive/p/yaprnn/), and a minimally fixed version is
on the `old-yaprnn` branch in this repository.

## How to use

* Have a Java 21+ distribution installed, e.g. [Eclipse Adoptium](https://adoptium.net/).
* Exec `gradlew run` on a terminal to run the java application.
